          In some market situations, you may find it difficult or impossible to
          liquidate a position. This may occur, for example, as a result of
          insufficient market liquidity or technical issues on Block Custody.

          Placing contingent Orders does not necessarily limit your losses to

      Please contact Block Custody first! Block Custody wants to address your concerns
      without resorting to formal legal proceedings, if possible. If you have a
      dispute with Block Custody, then you should contact Block Custody and a ticket number
      will be assigned. Block Custody will attempt to resolve your dispute internally
      as soon as possible. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to
      resolve the dispute (which discussions shall remain confidential and be
      subject to applicable rules protecting settlement discussions from use as
      evidence in any legal proceeding).<br /><br />In the event the dispute
      cannot be resolved satisfactorily, and you wish to assert a legal claim
      against Block Custody, then you agree to set forth the basis of such claim in
      writing in a “Notice of Claim,” as a form of prior notice to Block Custody. The
      Notice of Claim must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
      dispute, (2) set forth the specific relief sought, (3) provide the
      original ticket number, and (4) include your Block Custody account email. The
      Notice of Claim should be submitted to an email address or hyperlink
      provided in your correspondence with Block Custody. After you have provided the
      Notice of Claim to Block Custody, the dispute referenced in the Notice of Claim
      may be submitted by either Block Custody or you to arbitration in accordance
      with paragraph 2 of this Section, below. For the avoidance of doubt, the
      submission of a dispute to Block Custody for resolution internally and the
      delivery of a Notice of Claim to Block Custody are prerequisites to commencement

      shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.

      You and Block Custody Operators agree that, subject to paragraph 1 above, any
      dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Block Custody (and/or Block Custody
      Operators) arising in connection with or relating in any way to these
      Terms or to your relationship with Block Custody (and/or Block Custody Operators) as a
      user of Block Custody Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
      misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise
      during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by

      set forth below under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. You and
      Block Custody Operators further agree that the arbitrator shall have the
      exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including without
      limitation any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity
      of the Agreement to Arbitrate, or to the arbitrability of any claim or
      counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE
      IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION
      AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The
      arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and
      relief as a court (including, if applicable, attorney fees), except that
      the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief in favour of
      anyone but the parties to the arbitration. The arbitration provisions set
      forth in this Section will survive termination of these Terms. Arbitration
      Rules. The arbitration shall be subject to the HKIAC Administered
      Arbitration Rules (HKIAC. Rules) in force when the Notice of Arbitration

      administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC).
      Unless the parties agree otherwise, there shall be only one arbitrator
      appointed in accordance with the HKIAC Rules. Any arbitration will be
      conducted in the English language. Regardless of the manner in which the
      arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written
      decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
      which the decision and award, if any, are based. JUDGMENT ON ANY ARBITRAL
      AWARD MAY BE GIVEN IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTY (OR
      OVER THE ASSETS OF THE PARTY) AGAINST WHOM SUCH AN AWARD IS RENDERED. Time
      for Filing: ANY ARBITRATION AGAINST Block Custody OPERATORS MUST BE COMMENCED BY
      FILING A REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR, AFTER THE DATE THE
      PARTY ASSERTING THE CLAIM FIRST KNOWS OR REASONABLY SHOULD KNOW OF THE
      ACT, OMISSION OR DEFAULT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM; AND THERE SHALL BE NO
      RIGHT TO ANY REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM NOT ASSERTED WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD.
      THIS ONE YEAR LIMITATION PERIOD IS INCLUSIVE OF THE INTERNAL DISPUTE
      RESOLUTION PROCEDURE SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 1 OF THIS SECTION, ABOVE.
      THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT TO ANY REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM NOT ASSERTED WITHIN
      THAT TIME PERIOD. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period
      for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time
      period permitted by applicable law. Process; Notice: The party who intends
      to seek arbitration after the expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period
      set forth in paragraph 1, above, must submit a request to the HKIAC in
      accordance with the HKIAC Rules. If we request arbitration against you, we
      will give you notice at the email address or mailing address you have
      provided. You agree that any notice sent to this email or mailing address
      shall be deemed effective for all purposes, including without limitation
      to determinations of adequacy of service. It is your obligation to ensure
      that the email address and/or mailing address on file with Block Custody is
      up-to-date and accurate. Seat of Arbitration: The seat of the arbitration
      shall be Hong Kong. Place of Hearing: The location of any in-person
      arbitration hearing shall be Hong Kong, unless otherwise agreed to by the
      parties. Governing Law: These Terms (including this arbitration agreement)
      shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Hong
      Kong. Confidentiality. The parties agree that the arbitration shall be
      kept confidential. The existence of the arbitration, any nonpublic
      information provided in the arbitration, and any submissions, orders or
      awards made in the arbitration (together, the “Confidential Information”)
      shall not be disclosed to any non-party except the tribunal, the HKIAC,
      the parties, their counsel, experts, witnesses, accountants and auditors,
      insurers and reinsurers, and any other person necessary to the conduct of
      the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may disclose
      Confidential Information to the extent that disclosure may be required to
      fulfill a legal duty, protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce or
      challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings. This confidentiality
      provision shall survive termination of these Terms and of any arbitration
